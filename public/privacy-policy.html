  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      At Hot Takes, we take your privacy very seriously. This policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your personal information on our map-based social audio platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      The short version is: everything we collect is anonymized on the server. What we collect includes the content you share (takes), your phone number, your contacts, and your username. The takes you share are analyzed by AI, so we use transcription information from them in our models. The voice and photo content, however, can only be seen by your friends. The transcripts of your takes are anonymized and analyzed, and those may be summarized and shown to other users. 
    </p>
  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
      When you sign up for Hot Takes, we collect personal information that you provide us with, such as your name and phone number. We also collect information about your device, including your IP address, device type, and operating system.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may also collect information that you provide to us when you use our services, or application data, such as your location, takes, contacts, and audio recordings/takes, or any of your engagement with our app, such as reactions to takes. We may also collect information from third-party sources to improve our services, such as demographic or interest data, but as of September 2023 we do not collect any data from third party sources.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not collect any sensitive data from users. Any data collected from users, such as the items listed above, are fully anonymized on our servers/in our backend. More specifically, your contacts are only collected to show you suggested friends. We do not use your phone number for anything other than authentication. 
    </p>
  <h2>Data Usage</h2>
  <p>
    We use the data we collect to provide you with the best user experience possible. This includes personalizing your account, sending you notifications, and improving our services. We do not share any data linked to you with outside sources. All data used on our backend, such as for recommendations, is anonymized.
  </p>
    <p>
      In the future, we may use your data to provide you with targeted advertising or marketing communications that we believe may be of interest to you. 
    </p>
    <p>
    
      None of the content you share on the app is directly shared with anyone that is not your friend on the app—Your voice and pictures are only shown to your friends. We do not use this data for anything other than showing your friends. We do automatically generate transcripts from your takes, and we use these in the recommendation model that we are developing. None of the transcripts are tied to your identity or username in this use-case. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The only platforms whom we share your location data with is the Google Maps Platform APIs. You can read about their privacy policy <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">here</a>.
  </p>
  <h2>
    
    Data Protection
  </h2>
  <p>
    
    We take the protection of your personal information very seriously. We have implemented various security measures to ensure your data is safe, including encryption and regular backups. We also restrict access to your personal information to authorized employees who need to know that information to provide you with our services.
  </p>
  <p>
    
    We may retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy or as required by law. We will delete data from users 1 year after they have deleted their accounts. Please contact us if you would like us to delete your data before then.
  </p>
  <p>
    
    We do not knowingly solicit data from children under the age of 13. By using our services, you represent that you are at least 13 years old. If we learn that a user under the age limit has created an account, we will deactivate the account. 
  </p>
  <p>
    If a user would like us to delete their data, we will comply, please just reach out to our support email: hello@hottakes.social. We keep user data for up to one month after a user deletes their account. 
  </p>
